## Docker image of the sedex-client

The Docker image of the sedex client itself is publicly available in different versions on the Docker Hub at [hub.docker.com/r/sedexch/sedex-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/sedexch/sedex-client)

## What is sedex-client?

[**sedex**](http://www.sedex.ch) stands for *secure data exchange* and is a service of the [Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO)](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home.html).

At its core, the platform is a *message-oriented middleware* designed for secure asynchronous data exchange between business applications of different organizational units. In specific cases, synchronous data exchange (SOAP and RESTful web services) also takes place. The sedex platform is highly available (24/7).

The **sedex-client** is a software which is installed at the business applications and offers the interface between the business applications and the remote sedex server and message hub. Further details about the internal structure of the sedex client can be found in the installation and user manual on www.sedex.ch under Downloads.


## Installing sedex-client directly on your OS
