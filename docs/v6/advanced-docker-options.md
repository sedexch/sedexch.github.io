# Advanced Docker Options

This page describes advanced aspects of Docker Container configuration. Most of these options are rarely needed.


## Defining an outgoing HTTP-proxy in the init.conf

If an HTTP proxy is required to access the Internet, such a proxy server can optionally already be entered at the very beginning in the initial configuration file init.conf.

Example:

    File: /path/to/sedex-data/conf/init.conf
    ...
    OUTGOING_WEB_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.ch
    OUTGOING_WEB_PROXY_PORT=8080
    OUTGOING_WEB_PROXY_USER=example-user
    OUTGOING_WEB_PROXY_PASSWORD=1234
    
**Note:** If no user name is required, the two parameters OUTGOING_WEB_PROXY_USER and OUTGOING_WEB_PROXY_PASSWORD can be omitted. 

**Note:** An http proxy can also be configured manually in the central client configuration file at any time (see [Advanced sedex Client Configuration](sedex-client-configuration-options)).
    

## Disabling the Web Service Proxy in the init.conf

If the functionality of the sedex web service proxy for secure access to defined web services is not used, it can already be deactivated at the very beginning in the initial configuration file init.conf.

Example:

    File: /path/to/sedex-data/conf/init.conf
    ...
    WSPROXY_START=false

**Note:** If this parameter is missing in init.conf a default value of "true" will be set in the configuration file.

**Note:** If the use of the web service proxy is still required at a later date, it can be activated later by adjusting the central configuration file.


## Timezone
The default timezone in the sedex-client Docker container is "Europe/Zurich" (i.e. local Swiss time).
If you have to set another timezone (e.g. UTC) then set the environment variable **TZ** by adding the following option to your container run statement:

    --env TZ=UTC   



## Running the sedex-client as a non-root user
Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. The following steps describe how to set up a non-root group and user in case the host environment does not already provide these.

##### Step 1: Create a non-root group on the host machine
Determine a group ID (501 in the this example) that is unique on the host machine and create the group (the name does not have to be "sedex-group").

    $ groupadd --gid 501 sedex-group

##### Step 2: Create a non-root user on the host machine
Determine a user ID (901 in the this example) that is unique on the host machine and create the user (the name does not have to be "sedex-user"), assign it to the group created in the previous step, and specifying its home directory.

    $ useradd --uid 901 --no-log-init --gid sedex-group --create-home --home-dir /opt/sedexclient/ sedex-user

##### Step 3: Set the group and owner of the sedex-data directories
If the sedex-client will run as a non-root user inside of the Docker container, set the group and owner of the whole sedex-data directory tree and its contents so that the non-root user can access them.

    $ chown --recursive sedex-user:sedex-group /path/to/sedex-data

##### Step 4: Run the sedex-client container as a non-root user
Run the sedex-client container using environment-specific values for the following options:

- `/path/to/sedex-data` - The path to the host's "sedex-data" directory (holding the persisted data)
- `YOUR_MONITORING_PORT` - The port at which the monitoring web page of the sedex-client should be accessible from the outside of the container
- `YOUR_WS_PROXY_HTTP_PORT` - The unsecured http port at which the sedex-clients Web service proxy should be accessible from the outside of the
  container. **Note:** You can omit this line if the WS-Proxy will not be used or will only be used via https.
- `YOUR_WS_PROXY_HTTPS_PORT` - The secured https port at which the sedex-clients Web service proxy should be accessible from the outside of the
  container. **Note:** You can omit this line if the WS-Proxy will not be used.
- `--stop-timeout 65` - When the docker container is stopped (e.g. with "docker stop" command), the sedex-client's controller-stop.sh is executed to initiate a graceful 
  shutdown of the client. This typically takes longer than the default 10 seconds that the Docker daemon waits before killing the container.
  The --stop-timeout option overrides the default. The required time will vary from one installation to another.
- `--restart unless-stopped` - Restart Policy: Restart the container automatically after Docker daemon restarts, unless the container has been stopped intentionally. 
- `--user` - User: Sets the UID and GID used to start the sedex-client.
- `-d` - Detached: Start container in background without showing log output on console.

<!-- Start a new section to get Markdown to consider the following as code and not part of the list... -->

To run the sedex-client container as a non root user enter the following commands:

    $ docker pull sedexch/sedex-client:latest

    $ docker run \
      --name sedex-client \
      --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/sedex-data,destination=/sedex-data/ \
      --publish YOUR_MONITORING_PORT:8000 \
      --publish YOUR_WS_PROXY_HTTP_PORT:8080 \
      --publish YOUR_WS_PROXY_HTTPS_PORT:8443 \
      --stop-timeout 65 \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      --user 901:501 \
      -d \
      sedexch/sedex-client:latest



## Running a specific version of the container
If your are referencing the container by its name "sedexch/sedex-client" the version with the tag "latest" is automatically selected.
To use a specific sedex-client version and/or or a specific container version, use a versioned tag explicitly.
View the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/sedexch/sedex-client/tags) in the  Docker hub registry.

**Note:** For simplicity the run parameters are ommited in the following examples.
These parameters have to be set as described in the run example above.

Example: Run the latest Docker container of the latest sedex-client:

    $ docker run sedexch/sedex-client

or

    $ docker run sedexch/sedex-client:latest

Example: Run the latest Docker container of the sedex-client 6.0.0:

    $ docker run sedexch/sedex-client:6.0.0

Example: Run the Docker container 0.95-beta of the sedex-client 6.0.0:

    $ docker run sedexch/sedex-client:6.0.0_container-0.95-beta


## Pulling a specific image version
The "docker run" command does **not** automatically download a newer image from docker hub, if an older image with that name and tag is available locally.
In this case you have to manually issue a "docker pull" command, to download the newest images from docher hub.

Example: Get the latest Docker container of the latest sedex-client:

    $ docker pull sedexch/sedex-client

Example: Get the latest Docker container of the sedex-client 5.3.1:

    $ docker pull sedexch/sedex-client:6.0.0

Example: Get the Docker container 0.95-beta of the sedex-client 6.0.0:

    $ docker pull sedexch/sedex-client:6.0.0_container-0.95-beta


## Separate permanent stores for conf, log, etc.  
For the permanent store of data outside the container, most users will be happy to use one single directory "sedex-data" that holds all the different data types in one place:

- configuration
- sedex messages
- messaging state
- log files
- etc.

If you have good reasons to separate these stores, you can mount different subdirectories seperately:

    $ mkdir /path/to/sedex-conf
    $ mkdir /path/to/sedex-interface
    $ mkdir /path/to/sedex-internal
    $ mkdir /path/to/sedex-logs
    $ mkdir /path/to/sedex-monitoring

    $ docker run \
      --name sedex-client \
      --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/sedex-conf,destination=/sedex-data/conf/ \
      --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/sedex-interface,destination=/sedex-data/interface/ \
      --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/sedex-internal,destination=/sedex-data/internal/ \
      --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/sedex-logs,destination=/sedex-data/logs/ \
      --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/sedex-monitoring,destination=/sedex-data/monitoring/ \
      --publish YOUR_MONITORING_PORT:8000 \
      --publish YOUR_WS_PROXY_HTTP_PORT:8080 \
      --publish YOUR_WS_PROXY_HTTPS_PORT:8443 \
      --stop-timeout 65 \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      -d \
      sedexch/sedex-client:latest
