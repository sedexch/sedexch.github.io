# Overview of the sedex System

The sedex platform is a client-server *messaging system* that enables distributed business and e-government applications (from now on referred to as an end-user application) to exchange data securely, comprehensibly and reliably via the Internet.

The *sedex messaging system* can be divided into the following top level components:

1.	**End-user applications**<br/>
End-user applications that need to exchange business data (often in the form of XML documents) over the Internet.

2.	**sedex Client**<br/>
The sedex platform’s decentralized component. A Java-based application that enables one or more end-user applications to exchange business data in the form of messages via the sedex platform. The sedex Client is installed, configured and run by the operator of the end-user application. You are reading the manual that describes how to do this.

3.	**sedex Server**<br/>
The sedex platform’s central component via which all messages are exchanged. The sedex server is technically operated by the Federal Office of Information Technology (FOIT).

!!! note
    **The sedex system is asynchronous by design.**

    In practice a message may reach a recipient within about 1 minute, but that message transfer time is not guaranteed. For example, if the recipient’s sedex Client is down or offline, the message may never reach the receiver. In such a case, after 30 days of no delivery, the sender will be informed by a corresponding receipt generated by the system. Therefore, it is important that the sending end-user application processes the sedex receipts.
