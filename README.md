# Overview
This site contains the documentation in Markdown format based on MkDocs (https://www.mkdocs.org/) and Material Theme for MkDocs (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).


# How to publish

The publication to GitHub Pages can be done via two different ways:
- build the static site locally (e.g. using the docker image) and push the html site (folder site) to git hub
- push the rpository and let GitHub do the publication based on GitHub Actions
