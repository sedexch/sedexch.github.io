# Overview of the sedex System

** The *sedex* platform is a client-server *messaging system* of the Swiss federal government that enables distributed business and e-government applications (in short end-user applications) to exchange data via the Internet. The data transfer via sedex is secure, traceable and reliable.**


## Coponents of the sedex System

The *sedex messaging system* can be divided into the following top level components:

### 1. End-user applications

End-user applications that need to exchange business data (often in the form of XML documents) over the Internet.

### 2. sedex Client

The sedex platform’s decentralized component. A Java-based application that enables one or more end-user applications to exchange business data in the form of messages via the sedex platform. The sedex Client is installed, configured and run by the operator of the end-user application. You are reading the manual that describes how to do this.

### 3. sedex Server

The sedex platform’s central component via which all messages are exchanged. The sedex server is technically operated by the Federal Office of Information Technology (FOIT).


!!! note "Note: sedex Messaging is asynchronous by Design"

    In practice a message may reach a recipient within about 1 minute, but that message transfer time is not guaranteed. For example, if the recipient’s sedex Client is down or offline, the message may never reach the receiver. In such a case, after 30 days of no delivery, the sender will be informed by a corresponding receipt generated by the system. Therefore, it is important that the sending end-user application processes the sedex receipts.
